ssr
    browser -> next.js -> graphql api
client side 
    browser -> graphql api


when the page first loads, it does ssr request and cookie is not sent
and does not know who we are so vote status does not work

when I create a post it's going to make another request and after this
vote status work

we need to tell our server to send cookie to api
